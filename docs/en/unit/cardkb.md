## Description

**CardKB** is a unit with an implemented full-featured QWERTY keyboard. Consider that you want make some cool stuff that require keyboard typing and interaction, but M5 core by itself only has 3 buttons, what can you do? introducing CardKB, the flexible and powerful keyboard unit.

CardKB also can achieve button combination (Sym+Key, Shift+Key, Fn+Key) and output richer key value. This unit communicates with M5Core through GROVE A port (I2C interface). The default Address is 0x5F.

**1. Button combination description:**

* **Single button pressed**, keyboard will output the first key value (the letter button will output in a lower case form). E.g if "Q" was pressed, keyboard will output "q" (lower cased).

* **Sym+key**, keyboard will output the second key value. E.g if "Sym" was pressed and then "Q" was pressed, the keyboard will output "{". If "Sym" was double pressed, then the keyboard will lock this function, all key pressed will output it's second key value.

* **Shift+key**, if a letter button was pressed, it'll output upper case form. E.g if "Shift" was pressed and then "Q" was pressed, the keyboard will output "Q". If "Shift" was double pressed, then the keyboard will lock this function, all letter key pressed will output it's upper case form.

* **Fn+key(custom function key combination)**, keyboard will output the third key value. You can customize what function the key presses corresponds to.
