## Description

**ACCEL** is a motion sensor Unit. Integrated with ADXL 345 and ACC it is able to obtain 3-axis of Acceleration. ADXL 345 is a small, thin, ultra-low power consumption 3-axis accelerometer with high resolution (13-bit) measurement at up to ±16 g. Digital output data is formatted as 16-bit twos complement and it is accessible through I2C(addr:0x53) digital interface. In this Unit, we used I2C series interface.

*What is an accelerometer?*<br>
An accelerometer is an electromechanical device that will measure acceleration forces. These forces may be static, like the constant force of gravity pulling at your feet, or they could be dynamic - caused by moving or vibrating the accelerometer.
<br>

*What are accelerometers useful for?*<br>
By measuring the amount of static acceleration, due to gravity, you can find out the angle the device is tilted at with respect to the earth. By sensing the amount of dynamic acceleration - You can analyze the way the device is moving. At first, measuring tilt and acceleration doesn't seem all that exciting. However, engineers have come up with many ways to make really useful products with them.

>1.EasyLoader is a simple and fast program burner. Every product page in EasyLoader provides a product-related case program. It can be burned to the master through simple steps, and a series of function verification can be performed.

>2. After downloading the software, double-click to run the application, connect the M5 device to the computer through the data cable, select the port parameters, click **"Burn"** to start burning. (**For M5StickC burning, please Set the baud rate to 750000 or 115200**)

> 3. Currently EasyLoader is only suitable for Windows operating system, compatible with M5 system adopts ESP32 as the control core host. Before installing for M5Core, you need to install CP210X driver (you do not need to install with M5StickC as controller)[Click here to view the driver installation tutorial](en/related_documents/M5Burner#install-usb-driver)
