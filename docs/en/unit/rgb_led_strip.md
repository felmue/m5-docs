## Description

**RGB LED Strip** is a programmable RGB LED strip，utilizing SK6812 RGB LEDs. The LED strip supports digital addressing, which means that you can individually control the color and brightness of each individual LED on the LED strip. Single bus programming is supported to expand the LED strip.

The outer layer of the LED strip is coated with a transparent protective silica gel which supports IP65 waterproof protection, thus it can be adapted to a variety of applicable environments. The LED strip consists of a flexible FPC (soft light strip)/PCB (hard light strip board) for the substrate, and uses 5050 RGB LEDS, and 3M strong double-sided tape on the back for easy pasting and fixing. The working voltage is 5V DC voltage, and various lighting effects can be realized through controller programming.

>It should be noted that with the gradual increase in the number of LED strip connections, the accompanying power consumption will also increase. Therefore, when using RGB LED strips with a large number of LEDs, it is recommended to provide additional power for them.
