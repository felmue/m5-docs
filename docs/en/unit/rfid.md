## Description

**RFID** has an RFID **MFRC522** chip inside.

The MFRC522 operates in the 13.56MHz frequency band and uses the modulation and demodulation principle to interact with the proximity RF card.  This unit can realize the function of the card reading and writing device, to identify and record multiple card information, to encode and authority a RF card.

It is able tp establish applications such as access control system, punching system, warehouse goods storage and community vehicle access registration.

Connect this Unit to GROVE PORTA on M5Core, I2C address is 0x28.

>1.EasyLoader is a simple and fast program burner. Every product page in EasyLoader provides a product-related case program. It can be burned to the master through simple steps, and a series of function verification can be performed. .

>2. After downloading the software, double-click to run the application, connect the M5 device to the computer through the data cable, select the port parameters, click **"Burn"** to start burning. (**For M5StickC burning, please Set the baud rate to 750000 or 115200**)

>3. Currently EasyLoader is only suitable for Windows operating system, compatible with M5 system adopts ESP32 as the control core host. Before installing for M5Core, you need to install CP210X driver (you do not need to install with M5StickC as controller)[Click here to view the driver installation tutorial](en/related_documents/M5Burner#install-usb-driver)

## Example

### 1. Arduino

- [Click here to download the Arduino example](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Stack/tree/master/examples/Unit/RFID_RC522)

After programming the RFID.ino, the IC card or the mobile phone NFC, close to the unit, moves back and forth around the unit, and the UID of the IC card or the RFID chip in the mobile phone will be printed on the screen of the M5Core.

### 2. UIFlow

- [Click here to download the UIFlow example](https://github.com/m5stack/M5-ProductExampleCodes/tree/master/Unit/RFID/UIFlow)

After opening and burning this example using [UIFlow](http://flow.m5stack.com), place the proximity card on the Unit surface and the screen displays “True” and the UID number of the card.
