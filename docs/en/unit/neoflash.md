## Description

**NEOFLASH** is a RGB LED panel with 192 integrated LEDs and (WS2812C) RGB LED IC.

When you program this Unit, please pay attention to the sequence of the RGB LEDs. From top left (Where PIR placed) to right, and top to bottom.

Connect this unit with M5Core via GROVE PORTB Single-Bus.

We've added a magnet on the backside of the panel which means you can attach this to any metal surface.
When you plug the GROVE PORTA into M5core, you have convert it into 3 extended GROVE A laid on the side.

>1.EasyLoader is a simple and fast program burner. Every product page in EasyLoader provides a product-related case program. It can be burned to the master through simple steps, and a series of function verification can be performed. .

>2. After downloading the software, double-click to run the application, connect the M5 device to the computer through the data cable, select the port parameters, click **"Burn"** to start burning. (**For M5StickC burning, please Set the baud rate to 750000 or 115200**)

>3. Currently EasyLoader is only suitable for Windows operating system, compatible with M5 system adopts ESP32 as the control core host. Before installing for M5Core, you need to install CP210X driver (you do not need to install with M5StickC as controller)[Click here to view the driver installation tutorial](en/related_documents/M5Burner#install-usb-driver)


## Example

### 1. Arduino

This is an example that takes the time from online network server and displays it on NEOFLASH, show real time when someone is moving (some object detected) in front of the NEOFLASH, otherwise the time "disappears".
