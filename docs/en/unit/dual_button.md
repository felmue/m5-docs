## Description

**Dual Button** as the name states, has two buttons with different color. If the Button unit is not enough for your application needs, how about double it up to a pair? They share the exact same mechanism, button status can be detected by the input pin status by simply capturing the high/low electrical level.

This unit communicates with M5Core through GROVE B port.

>1.EasyLoader is a simple and fast program burner. Every product page in EasyLoader provides a product-related case program. It can be burned to the master through simple steps, and a series of function verification can be performed. .

>2. After downloading the software, double-click to run the application, connect the M5 device to the computer through the data cable, select the port parameters, click **"Burn"** to start burning. (**For M5StickC burning, please Set the baud rate to 750000 or 115200**)

>3. Currently EasyLoader is only suitable for Windows operating system, compatible with M5 system adopts ESP32 as the control core host. Before installing for M5Core, you need to install CP210X driver (you do not need to install with M5StickC as controller)[Click here to view the driver installation tutorial](en/related_documents/M5Burner#install-usb-driver)
