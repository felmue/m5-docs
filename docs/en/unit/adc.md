## Description

**ADC** unit is an integrated ADS1100 device which is a fully differential, 16-bit, self-calibrating, delta-sigma A/D converter.

It communicates through the I2C interface, which means you can collect AD data through PortA on the M5Core device in order to enhance your A/D capabilities and performance.

The default I2C address is 0x48 unless changed manually.

>1.EasyLoader is a simple and fast program burner. Every product page in EasyLoader provides a product-related case program. It can be burned to the master through simple steps, and a series of function verification can be performed. .

>2. After downloading the software, double-click to run the application, connect the M5 device to the computer through the data cable, select the port parameters, click **"Burn"** to start burning. (**For M5StickC burning, please Set the baud rate to 750000 or 115200**)

> 3. Currently EasyLoader is only suitable for Windows operating system, compatible with M5 system adopts ESP32 as the control core host. Before installing for M5Core, you need to install CP210X driver (you do not need to install with M5StickC as controller)[Click here to view the driver installation tutorial](en/related_documents/M5Burner#install-usb-driver)
