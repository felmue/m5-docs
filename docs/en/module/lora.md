## Description

**LoRa (433MHz)** is an integrated LoRa (433MHz) Module Ra-02, designed and produced by Ai-Thinker. On the board has some extra space left over, so we give you a prototyping area, it's great for adding on your customized circuit working with the LoRa (433MHz) Module.

LoRa (433MHz) enables long-range transmissions (more than 10 km in rural areas) with low power consumption，The technology is presented in two parts: LoRa (433MHz), the physical layer and LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network), the upper layers.

LoRa (433MHz) and LoRaWAN permit long-range connectivity for Internet of Things (IoT) devices in different types of industries.

>1.EasyLoader is a simple and fast program burner. Every product page in EasyLoader provides a product-related case program. It can be burned to the master through simple steps, and a series of function verification can be performed.

>2.After downloading the software, double-click to run the application, connect the M5 device to the computer via the data cable, select the port parameters, and click **"Burn"** to start burning.

>3.The CP210X (USB driver) needs to be installed before the EasyLoader is burned. [Click here to view the driver installation tutorial](en/related_documents/M5Burner#install-usb-driver)

## Example

### 1. Arduino IDE

These are the point-to-point communication [examples](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Stack/tree/master/examples/Modules/LoRa433_SX1278) between two LORA modules. The LoRa nodes send and receive messages.

* Blue string indicates sending succeed.

* Yellow string display the received messages.

* Red string indicates initialization failed.
