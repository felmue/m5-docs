## Description

**GROVE-T** is a T-shaped hub. Is this remind you the HUB unit ? They are basically the same thing, just in different shape.This is also used for HY2.0-4P port expanding.

Notice: **GROVE-T** is just a hardware expander, if you are looking for hardware and software(standard protocol) expander like I2C, Single-bus, please check **PaHUB** or **PbHUB**. If you connectted two I2C slave devices onto **HUB** that share the same adress, you will have problem getting I2C data from both.
