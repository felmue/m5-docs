## ESP-NOW

#### Function Description

>ESP-NOW is a short-range, low-power communication protocol that enables multiple devices to communicate without Wi-Fi. This protocol is similar to the low-power 2.4GHz wireless connection found in wireless miceâ€”devices are paired before communicating. After pairing, the connections between devices are continuous, peer-to-peer, and do not require a handshake protocol.

><img src="image\ESP_now\esp_now_01.webp" width="50%">

Receive data, get the sender's mac address and the data content carried

* __After send message flag__
Send a callback function, automatically execute the callback function after executing the send message, and return whether the flag bit flag is successfully sent. The success is True and the failure is False.

* __Send message id with data__
Send data to the device with the specified id.


#### Instructions

<h3><mark>Receiver</mark></h3>

> Display the local mac address on the screen, use the data receiving block and create two variables for receiving the sender's address and data content. The data is processed inside the receiving block function for display or judgment and other operations. For example, the following program controls the LED light switch by judging whether the received data is "1".

__Note: The created variable name is not allowed to be consistent with the parameter name, ie variables with the names "addr" and "data" are not allowed to be used for data acquisition __

><img src="image\ESP_now\esp_now_02.webp" width="40%">

<h3><mark>Sender</mark></h3>

> Add the mac address of the receiving device, fill in the sent data content in the sending program, select the id of the receiving device. Use the button program to control the data transmission. Using the callback function can help us determine whether the data is successfully sent from the machine. We need to use a variable to get its return result.

__Note: The created variable name is not allowed to be consistent with the parameter name, ie variables with the name "flag" are not allowed to be used for data acquisition __

><img src="image\ESP_now\esp_now_03.webp" width="40%">

>Complete the program editing, respectively run the receiver and transmitter programs, you can achieve ESP-NOW short-range wireless communication.

?>Note: When running ESP-NOW, if the communication devices are connected to the same WiFi network, there is no need to configure the communication channel, and the communication can be normal. Otherwise, please configure the communication channel in the program and download the program to the device for runinng.

## MQTT communication

#### What is MQTT?

>MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a "lightweight" communication protocol based on publish/subscribe (publish/subscribe) mode.

> The protocol was built on the TCP/IP protocol and was released by IBM in 1999.

>The biggest advantage of MQTT is that it can provide real-time and reliable message service for connecting remote devices with very little code and limited bandwidth.

>As a low-overhead, low-bandwidth instant messaging protocol, it has a wide range of applications in the Internet of Things, small devices, and mobile applications.

#### UIFlow and MQTT

>In UIFlow, we can use MQTT function to realize communication and interaction between two or more COREs, thus achieving powerful remote control functions.

><img src="/image/MQTT/MQTT.webp" width="50%"> 


## MQTT server

* __Select MQTT Service__

> To use the MQTT protocol for data interaction, you need server support. There are many third-party server platforms to choose from. The platform we demonstrate here is CloudMQTT.

>When you have created service support on the platform, you will get some configuration information, such as server address, username, password, etc., which will be used in UIFlow's MQTT block.

><img src="/image/MQTT/info.webp" width="50%"> 



* __MQTT fuction__

> In the advanced functions of UIFlow, you can find the MQTT function block. We can simply understand the MQTT protocol as two links, "Publish" and "Subscribe".

> When the publisher posts a message, the subscriber will get this information to enable communication between devices

><img src="/image/MQTT/UIFlow_MQTT.webp" width="50%">


## Initialization procedure

* __MQTT configuration block__

>Add an MQTT configuration block and connect to the Setup block

><img src="/image/MQTT/MQTT_Start1.webp" width="50%"> 

* __information to fill in__

> Fill in the server information on your personal or third-party server platform to prepare for the next connection

## attention

* When you have multiple devices at the same time, the ID name (the ID below is "M5stack") is not allowed to be duplicated with other options in the configuration information, and it is not allowed to duplicate the IDs of other devices. At the same time, the same server In the device with the same ID name, only one online is allowed.

><img src="/image/MQTT/MQTT_Start2.webp" width="50%">

The Slave receives the data package of address code 1, function number 1 and register address 1, and then parses the data. if the data is 1 to light the LED bar, and if the data is 2 to turn off the LED Bar, at the same time, the Slave updates its own corresponding data in real time and responds to the Master (through function code 2). The Slave will also report the data to theMaster in real time through pressed A / B button. There are two ways to achieve this:

>1.Process the data package returned from the Slave through loop-cycle, update the data on the screen in time and respond.

Receive the specified packet and analyze the data, judge the data to respond and report to the Master (via function number 2), press A / B button to respond to itself, and send the packet report status to the Master (via function number 2)

><img src="/image/Advanced module/modbus_loop_slave_user.webp" width="100%">
