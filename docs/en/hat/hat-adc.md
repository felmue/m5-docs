## Description

**ADC HAT**  is another type of C-HAT specifically design for M5StickC controller. Same as ADC unit, this is an ADC converter component for stickc. Packed with an ADC converter chip ADS1100, which is a fully differential, 16-bit, self-calibrating, delta-sigma A/D converter. Extremely easy to design with and configure, the ADS1100 allows you to obtain precise measurements with a minimum of effort.
<br>
The ADS1100 consists of a delta-sigma A/D converter core with adjustable gain, a clock generator, and an I2C interface.
<br>
ADS1100 itself is able to accept a differential input from -5 ~ +5 V, but we have limited the input to 0~12V by adding on the peripheral circuit design of this IC.
