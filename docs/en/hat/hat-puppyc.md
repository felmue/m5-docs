## Description

**PuppyC** is a programmable four-legged robot base compatible with M5StickC. It contains the STM32F030F4 microcontroller，Four SG90 micro servos, a battery holder and an independent switch.

PuppyC base needs to be used in conjunction with the M5StickC controller.After the StickC is programmed, it communicates with PuppyC through the I2C protocol (0x38) to control the steering motion.

It walks slowly and is easy to control.Due to the small contact area, the movement is slow and the frictional force is as large as possible even on a soft surface.

>1.EasyLoader is a simple and fast program burner. Every product page in EasyLoader provides a product-related case program. This can be burned to the M5 device through simple steps, and a series of function verifications can be performed.

>2.After downloading the software, double-click to run the application, connect the M5 device to the computer through the data cable, select the port parameters, click **"Burn"** to burn the program (**For M5StickC, set the baud rate to 115200 or 750000**)
